\description{
The European Consumer Satisfaction Index (ECSI) is an economic indicator that
measures customer satisfaction. ECSI is an adaptation of the Swedish Customer
Satisfaction Barometer (Fornell, 1992) and is compatible with the American
Customer Satisfaction Index.  The indicators describing the latent variables
are given for the Mobile Phone Industry. The original items scaled from 1 to
10 have been transformed into new normalized variables. The minimum possible
value of each variable is 0 and its maximum possible value is equal to 10.
