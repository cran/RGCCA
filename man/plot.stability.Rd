\title{Plot a rgcca_stability object.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{stability}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of type "stability" produced by rgcca_stability.}

\item{...}{Arguments for the plot.rgcca function.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot object.
}
\description{
The fitted RGCCA model returned by rgcca_stability is plotted.
All arguments are forwarded to the plot.rgcca function.
